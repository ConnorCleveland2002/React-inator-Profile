            <p>
              Fun Finder was a group project, in which the goal was to
              successfully use an API to create a functional web application. We
              decided as a group to create an application centred around getting
              people who fele locked up at home during Covid outside and doing
              some events. So, we designed an interface where users can select
              their location, add their interests by keyword or category, and a
              few other constraints, and then they recieve a list of events that
              matcdh up with the user input. From there, users can save certain
              events they find interesting and go to their saved page to view
              their saved events in a carousel.

            </a>
            <p>
              Weather Dashboard's goal was to get a week's forecast on a certain
              location, and to get weather-related data on the location for the
              whole week. Users can input their location or use a custom
              location in the search field, and a return will come from the
              search giving back Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, and UV Index,
              as well as an image relating to the weather of that area dependant
              on the current conditions in that area. This was a solo
              assignment, and one I had allot of fun creating.

            <p>
              Note-Taker-inator's goal was to create a note-taking programme,
              and allow users to create and store their notes on a deployed
              site. This was a solo projects, and included a user being able to
              add a new note with a title and contents, then being able to save
              on their local machine the notes that they took, as well as the
              ability to be able to delete any notes they had taken but didn't
              need anymore.
